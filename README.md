# Spark-with-Scala-Project
Using Spark's immutable RDDs and diverse functions of Scala to crunch a large dataset for data analysis. Also to deploy a Spark Standalone Cluster and use the parallelization feature in Spark to run the Monte-Carlo algorithm for two hundred thousand simulations in order to reach an accurate approximation of Pi.
